# PredictStockPriceWithNews

This project aims to predict stock price performance using news analytics. Original data were fetched from Kaggle Competition: https://www.kaggle.com/c/two-sigma-financial-news

The data were inially cleaned and sorted using Python. After reducing the number of features using PCA we fed the data into a linear dynamic model.
