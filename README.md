# PredictStockPriceWithNews

This project aims to predict stock price performance using news analytics. Original data were fetched from Kaggle Competition: https://www.kaggle.com/c/two-sigma-financial-news

We first cleaned and sorted the raw data using Python. After reducing the number of features using Principle Component Analysis we fed the data into a modified auto-regressive model.
